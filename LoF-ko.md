# 형태의 법칙들 Laws of Form

## 1.형태 The form

우리가 구별과 지시의 두 개념을 취한다면, 먼저 구별하지 않고 지시할 수 없다. 그래서 형태를 다루기 위해서는 구별의 형태를 먼저 취한다. 

## 정의

* 구별은 완전한 포함이다.



We take as given the idea of distinction and idea of indication,  and that we cannot make an indication without drawing a distinction. We take, therefore, the form of distinction for the form.

### Definition

*Distinction is perfect continence.[^c1-1]

That is to say, a distinction is drawn by arranging a boundary with seperate sides so that a point on one side cannot reach the other side without crossing the boundry. For example, in a plane space a cicle draws a distinction.

Once a distinction is drawn, the spaces, states or contents on each side of the boundry, being distinct, can be indicated.

there can be no distinction without motive, and there can be no motive unless contents are seen to differ in value.

If a content is of value, a name can be taken to indicate this value. Thus the calling of the name can be identified with the value of the content.

### Axiom 1. The law of calling

*The value of a call made again is the value of the call.*

That is to say, if a name is called and then is called again, the value indicated by the two calls taken together is the value indicated by one of them.
That is to say, for any name, to recall is to call.
Equally, if the content is of value, a motive or an intention or instruction to cross the boundary into the content can be taken to indicate this value.
Thus, also, the crossing of the boundry can be identified with the value of the content.

### Axion 2. The law of crossing

*the value of a crossing made again is not the value of the crossing.*

That is to say, if it is intended to cross a boundary and then it is intended to cross it again, the value indicated by the two intentions taken together is the value indicated by none of them.
That is to say, for any boundary, to recross is not to cross.

[^c1-1]: There have been so many jokes about this that I had better point out that I was employing "continence" in its original sense of "containment", not in its later usage as "sexual abstinence" -  Author, reviewing this text 2000-06-27
